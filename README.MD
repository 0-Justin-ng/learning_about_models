    - Attempt to Implement every model from Intro to Statistical Learning 7th ed. 
        - This is to help beginners understand how each model works. 
    - Separate the models into Parametric and Non-parametric. 
    - The minimum viable product will have the ability to run the models on a toy dataset and make predictions. 
    - Nice to have a GUI to show how the simpler models behave.
