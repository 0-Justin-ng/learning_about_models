1. Define Project
    - Implement every model from Intro to Statistical Learning 7th ed. from scratch.
        - This is to help beginners understand how each model works. 
    - Separate the models into Parametric and Non-parametric. 
    - The minimum viable product will have the ability to run the models on a toy dataset and make predictions. 
    - Nice to have a GUI to show how the simpler models behave. 

2. What components do you need.
    - Dataset simple the better. 
        - 1 for regression
        - 2 for classification
            - 1 w/ 2 labels.
            - 1 w/ > 2 Labels.
